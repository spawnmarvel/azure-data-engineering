### Get started with data engineering on Azure

#### What is data engineering

Types of data
* Structured, table based, relation, or flat file csv
* Semi-structured, JSON
* Unstructured, pdf, word and images

Data integration
* Data Integration involves establishing links between operational and analytical services and data sources to enable secure, reliable access to data across multiple systems. 

Data transformation
* Operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process; though increasingly a variation in which you extract, load, and transform (ELT)

Data consolidation
* Data consolidation is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure - usually to support analytics and reporting.
